"""Shared DXF geometry stitching.

Onshape (and other CAD) DXF exports represent a face boundary as many individual
LINE / ARC / ELLIPSE / SPLINE / open-POLYLINE segments rather than one closed
polyline. Turning those back into closed boundary paths is needed in two places:

  1. 2D import  - frc_cam_postprocessor.load_dxf (machines the paths directly)
  2. 2.5D build - onshape_integration._convert_geometry_to_solid_hatch (rebuilds a
                  solid-HATCH negative-space DXF from per-depth Onshape exports)

Both call entities_to_closed_paths() so the sampling and stitching live in ONE place
(a missing entity type here previously had to be fixed twice - e.g. ELLIPSE).
